### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One challenge encountered was a discrepancy in the appearance of the expected chart vs the actual chart produced for Outcomes Based on Goals. Determined to be the result of an error in the data used for expected chart vs the data provided for the creation of the actual chart.

Screenshots of expected vs produced. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  1.	Kickstarters under the theater category or more successful during summer months considering the higher rates of success during the months between May and Aug.
  2.	Kickstarters under the theater category are rarely cancelled, most are ran until they are successful or fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The fundraising goal is not much of a deciding factor on whether kickstarters that fall under the Plays subcategory are successful, considering most succeed regardless of the amount required to meet the fundraising goal.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Kickstarters that are cancelled but still meet their fundraising goal are not necessarily deemed successful. A kickstarter might be cancelled before deadline      because it was successful in its fundraising goal before deadline, and did not want to incur any additional contributions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  1. A table and graph can be created to show on average how long it might take for these types of kickstarters to ultimately reach their goal.
  2. A table and graph can be created to show how many kickstarters that are designated as staff_picks are successful.
